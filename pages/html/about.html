                    From the french <mark>conduit</mark> means <mark>behavior</mark>. 
                    And there was a special journal in some educational institutions, 
                    called <mark>conduit</mark>, for recording students' misdemeanors.
                    With the development of society <mark>conduits</mark> turned into 
                    ordinary school diaries. So this platform is some kind of electronic 
                    diary for different kinds of educational organizations.

                    Our main goal is to make education open and <b>available for everybody</b>
                    by connecting organizators of different educational events with potential 
                    participants. We are welcome you to join us and recieve useful experience.

                <p class="mt-4 ml-1">
                    There are several strategies that can be chosen by you for using this platform:
                </p>

                <ul class="mt-4 ml-1">
                    <li>
                        <h5>I organize</h5>
                        <p>
                            This strategy is recomended for oranizations or individual persons, 
                            who want to connect two parts of education: teachers and students, and
                            want to do this convenient.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We know how it is hard to manage 
                            <u>contacts</u>, <u>groups</u>, <u>schedules</u>, <u>billings</u>, 
                            and many other things in <i>EXCEL</i> tables. So we offer you
                            opportunities of <mark>conduit</mark> to make bureaucracy work easier.

                            <b>Our platform has the next stucture:</b>

                            each event <span class="text-secondary">(summer camp, 
                            club of interests, ...)</span> refers to some period of time, 
                            and we assign <code>period</code> as basic item. For each 
                            <code>period</code> users will need to make new applications for 
                            participation <span class="text-secondary"> (due to many 
                            <b>reasons:</b> students become elder and change classes, or even 
                            become teachers; structures reorganizations; ...)</span>.

                            In <code>period</code> users can be divided in <code>groups</code> of
                            different types: <i>INFORMATION</i>, <i>ELIMINATION</i>, <i>STUDY</i>;
                            with their own roles, privacy and rules. <code>Group</code> is the
                            second structure item, which includes <code>participants</code> 
                            <span class="text-secondary">(teachers, students)</span> and study 
                            <code>events</code> <span class="text-secondary">
                            (topics, olympiads, games, ...)</span>. The last ones can be
                            customized in different ways: <code>topics</code> can contains
                            problems, slides, vieos, attachmentns; <code>olympiads</code> can
                            be short or long, writing or oral; <code>games</code> from list 
                            implemented ones, rated or unrated, personal or in team.
                            And everything is reinforced with standard requirements as 
                            <u>checking attendance</u>, <u>performance assessment</u>,
                            <u>statistics</u> and so on.

                        <p>
                            This strategy is recomended to someone, who wants to be directly 
                            involoved in study process and spend time telling interesting,
                            useful things; developing skills and abilities; checking homeworks 
                            and wants to do this convenient.

                            From the first hands we know how it is painful to enter results
                            in a table when they are on many sheets of paper and change during
                            the assessment; we know that students often lose their papers with
                            problems or that you want to show some material but it is too expensive
                            to print it for each student. So we tried to solve such difficulties in
                            some ways on <mark>conduit</mark> platform and suggest that you 
                            appreciate it.

                                        <code>Sheet</code> is collection of problems that should be
                                        solved in bounded period of time. At the same time it can
                                        be used for <u>topics</u> which are explained in class room 
                                        or for <u>olympiads</u> which also can be of different types
